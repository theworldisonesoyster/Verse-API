### Data
| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| AgentCollideEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled when the carryable collides with an agent. Damage applied is based off the collision velocity, as well as the device's Impact Damage settings. This event will fire even if the damage applied is 0. |
| CanTakeDamage | ?logic | Maps to the device option for Takes Damage. Whether or not the carryable takes damage / can be destroyed. |
| CarryableObjectTransform | ??transform | The carryable transform, if the carryable exists in-world. |
| CarryingAgent | ??agent | The agent carrying the carryable, if one exists. |
| DropEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled when agent drops the carryable. Includes manual drop as well as force drop, which can occur on entering a state that doesn't support carrying, such as elimination. |
| ExplodeEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled when the carryable explodes. Returns the instigating agent, if one exists. The agent provided to the Explode function, or the agent who dealt lethal damage to the carryable. Otherwise, the agent who most recently carried the item. Returns an array of agents affected by the explosion. |
| ExplosionDamage | ?float | Maps to the device option for Explosion Character Damage. Describes how much damage is done to characters caught in the carryable explosion. |
| ExplosionEnvironmentalDamage | ?float | Maps to the device option for Explosion Environmental Damage. Describes how much damage is done to world objects caught in the carryable explosion. |
| ExplosionImpulse | ?float | Maps to the device option for Explosion Impulse. Describes the strength of the knockback impulse applied by the carryable explosion. |
| ExplosionRadius | ?float | Maps to the device option for Explosion Radius. Describes the radius (in meters) of the carryable explosion. |
| ImpactDamage | ?float | Maps to the device option for Impact Character Damage. Describes how much damage is done to characters hit by the carryable. This value is scaled by the impact magnitude to calculate the applied damage. |
| ImpactEnvironmentalDamage | ?float | Maps to the device option for Impact Environmental Damage. Describes how much damage is done to world objects hit by the carryable. This value is scaled by the impact magnitude to calculate the applied damage. |
| InitialSpawnAngle | ?float | Maps to the device option for Initial Spawn Angle. The angle (in degrees) of the cone from which the carryable will be randomly tossed when it first spawns. |
| InitialSpawnVelocity | ?float | Maps to the device option for Initial Spawn Velocity. The velocity (in meters per second) applied to the carryable when it first spawns. |
| PickUpEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled when agent picks up the carryable. |
| ReleaseEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled when agent stops carrying the carryable. This includes dropping, throwing, despawning, or force pickup by another player. |
| SpawnEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled when the carryable spawns, either by the Spawn function, or by timer. |
| StartingHealth | ?float | Maps to the device option for Starting Health. Describes how much health the carryable spawns with. |
| ThrowEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled when agent throws the carryable. |

### Functions
| Function Name | Description |
| Despawn | Despawn the carryable, if it exists. |
| Disable | Disables this device, preventing it from listening for inputs and sending events. When disabled, the carryable is unspawned, if it exists. |
| Enable | Enables this device, allowing it to listen for inputs and send events. |
| Explode | Explode the carryable, if it exists. |
| Explode | Explode the carryable, if it exists. Assigns the provided agent as the explosion instigator. |
| ForcePlayerToCarry | Forces the carryable to be carried by the provided player, teleporting it into their hands. If not in a viable state to carry the item (such as in a vehicle), or if the player fails the device's filters, it is ignored. |
| GetGlobalTransform | Gets the global transform of this object. |
| GetTransform | Returns the transform of the creative_object with units in cm. You must check creative_object.IsValid before calling this if there is a possibility the object has been disposed or destroyed by gameplay. Otherwise a runtime error will result. |
| IsEnabled | Succeeds if the object is enabled, fails if it is disabled. |
| IsSpawned | Fails if the carryable does not exist in-world. |
| MoveTo | Moves the creative_object to the specified Position and Rotation over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the creative_object it will be stopped and put into the AnimationNotSet state. |
| MoveTo | Moves the creative_object to the specified Transform over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the creative_object it will be stopped and put into the AnimationNotSet state. |
| MoveTo | Moves the creative_device to the specified Transform over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the creative_device it will be stopped and put into the AnimationNotSet state. |
| SetCarryableMaterial | Set the material of the carryable. Index describes which material index on the mesh the material will apply to. This will update immediately if already spawned, and also apply to any carryable spawned from this device in the future. |
| SetCarryableMesh | Set the mesh of the carryable. This will update immediately if already spawned, and also apply to any carryable spawned from this device in the future. |
| SetGlobalTransform | Sets the global transform of this object. |
| Spawn | Spawn the carryable from the device if it doesn't currently exist. |
| TeleportTo | Teleports the creative_object to the specified Position and Rotation. |
| TeleportTo | Teleports the creative_object to the specified location defined by Transform, also applies rotation and scale accordingly. |
| TeleportTo | Teleports the creative_device to the specified location defined by Transform, also applies rotation and scale accordingly. |
