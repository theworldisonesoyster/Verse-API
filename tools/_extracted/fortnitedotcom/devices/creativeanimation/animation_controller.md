## Members
This class has both data members and functions.

### Data
| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| KeyframeReachedEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled each time a keyframe is reached. Callback(KeyframeIndex:int, InReverse:logic). Note that the KeyframeIndex in the callback is generally in [1, NumDeltaKeyframes] except that in a PingPong animation the final keyframe played in reverse is identified as index 0. This is because SetAnimation takes delta keyframes whereas this event notifies the listener that a specific keyframe has been reached. |
| MovementCompleteEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled when the entire animation is complete. This will only fire for OneShot animations. |
| StateChangedEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled when the state has changed. Use GetState to get the new state. |

### Functions
| Function Name | Description |
| AwaitNextKeyframe | Suspends at the callsite until the next keyframe_delta is finished. This will also return if the animation is aborted or not playing. See await_next_keyframe_result if your code needs to take different paths based on why AwaitNextKeyframe returned. |
| Play | Starts or resumes playback of the animation. |
| Pause | Pauses the animation if it is already playing. |
| Stop | Stops playback and resets the animation to the first keyframe. Also resets the prop transform. Calling this method is valid while the animation is in the Playing or Paused states. |
| GetState | Returns the current state of this animation_controller. |
| IsValid | Succeeds if this animation_controllers target is still valid (i.e., the target has not been disposed of either via Dispose or through any external system.) |
| SetAnimation | Sets the animation for the animation_controller. Animations are processed in the order provided in Keyframes. See notes in keyframe_delta and animation_mode for more details on controlling the animations. |
