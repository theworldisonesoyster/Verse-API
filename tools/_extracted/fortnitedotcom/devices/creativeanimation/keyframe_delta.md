Instead of specifying the actual keyframe positions, we specify the keyframe deltas. This allows us to treat the initial position of the prop as keyframe 0 and avoid the question of how to get the prop to its initial location. For a animation_mode.Loop animation, the net rotation and translation must both be zero. Each delta is interpreted as a world-space transformation to be concatenated onto the previous transform(s).

## Members
This struct has data members, but no functions.

### Data
| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| DeltaLocation | vector3 | Target position of the creative_prop. This is a world-space coordinate in cm, with the initial position of the creative_prop acting as coordinate (0,0). |
| DeltaRotation | rotation | Target rotation for the creative_prop. Rotations are relative to the starting rotation of the creative_prop |
| DeltaScale | vector3 | Target scale for the creative_prop. Scale is multiplicative to the starting Scale of the creative_prop |
| Time | float | Time in seconds the creative_prop should animate between its last frame and this frame. |
| Interpolation | cubic_bezier_parameters | Interpolation mode for this keyframe_delta. See InterpolationTypes for standard interpolation options. See cubic_bezier_parameters for authoring custom interpolations. Default = InterpolationTypes.Linear |
