You can set this to the same value as the Hidden Travel Group option, or if you have multiple groups of hiding props you can target a different group. Modifying this value will take effect the next time a player attempts a hidden travel. Leaving this value unset means that this hiding_prop_device will not be able to cause a Hidden Travel when players hide inside of it. |
| MaxHideTime | ??float | This value maps to the 'Max Hiding Time' user option. Sets a maximum amount of time a player can hide in the prop before being ejected.
