### Data
| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| ActivateEvent | listenable(payload) | Triggers when the Spire becomes activated from players entering the Activation Distance |
| ActivationDistance | ?float | Determines the distance where approaching players activate the Spire. Values are clamped between 500.0 and 10000.0 cm |
| BeginChargeLaserEvent | listenable(payload) | Triggers when the Spire begins its laser attack |
| DeactivateEvent | listenable(payload) | Triggers when the Spire becomes deactivated, either from players leaving the Activation Distance |
| DestroyEvent | listenable(payload) | Triggers when the Spire is destroyed from damage or events Includes the agent that destroyed it, if any. |
| EndChargeAndFireLaserEvent | listenable(payload) | Triggers when the Spire shoots its laser attack. Triggers once, even if it shoots at multiple targets |
| Health | ?float | The Spire's current health. Clamped between 0 and MaxHealth. Setting this value does nothing if the Spire is destroyed. |
| IsShieldActive | ?logic | If the invulnerable shield for this Spire is active. While active, the Spire cannot take damage. Setting this value does nothing if the Spire is destroyed. |
| LaserAdditionalVerticalImpulseForce | ?float | Determines the additive vertical force of the impulse applied to targets of the laser attack. Values are clamped between 0.0 and 10000.0 |
| LaserAttackDamageToBuildings | ?float | Determines how much total damage the laser attack does to buildings. Values are clamped between 0.0 and 10000.0 |
| LaserAttackDamageToCreatures | ?float | Determines how much total damage the laser attack does to creatures. Values are clamped between 0.0 and 10000.0 |
| LaserAttackDamageToGuards | ?float | Determines how much total damage the laser attack does to guards. Values are clamped between 0.0 and 10000.0 |
| LaserAttackDamageToPlayers | ?float | Determines how much total damage the laser attack does to players. Values are clamped between 0.0 and 10000.0 |
| LaserAttackDamageToVehicles | ?float | Determines how much total damage the laser attack does to vehicles. Values are clamped between 0.0 and 10000.0 |
| LaserAttackDamageToWildlife | ?float | Determines how much total damage the laser attack does to wildlife. Values are clamped between 0.0 and 10000.0 |
| LaserChargeTime | ?float | Determines the time it takes for the Spire to charge up its laser attack. Values are clamped between 0.5 and 60.0 |
| LaserCooldownTime | ?float | Determines the amount of time that the Spire must wait to use the laser attack after previously using it. Values are clamped between 0.5 and 60.0 |
| LaserEffectRadius | ?float | Determines the radius of the blast from where the laser hits. Values are clamped between 100.0 and 1000.0 |
| LaserHorizontalImpulseForce | ?float | Determines the multiplicative horizontal force of the impulse applied to targets of the laser attack based on distance. Values are clamped between 0.0 and 10000.0 |
| LasersPerCharge | ?int | Determines the number of targets the Spire can shoot lasers at per charged attack. Values are clamped between 1 and 50 |
| LaserVerticalImpulseForce | ?float | Determines the multiplicative vertical force of the impulse applied to targets of the laser attack based on distance. Values are clamped between 0.0 and 10000.0 |
| MaxHealth | ?float | The maximum health of this Spire. |
| ShowMapIcon | ?logic | Determines if a Spire-specific icon should be displayed on the map while the Spire is spawned. |

### Functions
| Function Name | Description |
| Despawn | Hides the spire immediately without playing any vfx Does nothing if the Spire is already destroyed or despawned. |
| Destroy | Sets the Spire's health to zero, destroying it. Does nothing if the Spire has not spawned or is already destroyed. |
| Disable | Disable the device which causes the Spire to become deactivated, stopping the behaviors and attacks, as well as preventing activation when players are within the Activation Distance. Does nothing if the Spire is destroyed or already disabled. |
| Enable | Enable the device, causing the Spire to become activated when players are within the Activation Distance. Does nothing if the Spire is destroyed or already enabled. |
| GetGlobalTransform | Gets the global transform of this object. |
| GetTransform | Returns the transform of the creative_object with units in cm. You must check creative_object.IsValid before calling this if there is a possibility the object has been disposed or destroyed by gameplay. Otherwise a runtime error will result. |
| IsActivated | If this Spire is currently activated. Succeeds if activated. Fails if deactivated An activated Spire will react to enemies and take damage * Becomes activated from being enabled and players entering the Activation Distance |
| IsDestroyed | Succeeds if this Spire's health has reached 0. Fails otherwise. |
| IsEnabled | Succeeds if the Spire is enabled and fails if it is disabled. While disabled, the Spire is inactive: it will not react to players or take damage. If the Spire is currently despawned, this function instead reports the enabled state the Spire will have the next time it is spawned. |
| IsSpawned | Succeeds if this Spire is in a spawned state. Fails if the Spire is destroyed or has not spawned. |
| MoveTo | Moves the creative_object to the specified Position and Rotation over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the creative_object it will be stopped and put into the AnimationNotSet state. |
| MoveTo | Moves the creative_object to the specified Transform over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the creative_object it will be stopped and put into the AnimationNotSet state. |
| MoveTo | Moves the creative_device to the specified Transform over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the creative_device it will be stopped and put into the AnimationNotSet state. |
| Reset | Resets the Spire to its initial state. |
| SetGlobalTransform | Sets the global transform of this object. |
| Spawn | Spawns the Spire, causing it to become visible and enabling collision Does nothing if the Spire is already spawned or destroyed. |
| TeleportTo | Teleports the creative_object to the specified Position and Rotation. |
| TeleportTo | Teleports the creative_object to the specified location defined by Transform, also applies rotation and scale accordingly. |
| TeleportTo | Teleports the creative_device to the specified location defined by Transform, also applies rotation and scale accordingly. |
