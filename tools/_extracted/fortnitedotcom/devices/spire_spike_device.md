A Destroyable environment prop that when destroyed, drops loot. When players approach the Spire Spike, they start a countdown to a knockback ability. When players are knocked back, they do not receive damage from the knockback ability or take fall damage. They can destroy structures near the knockback location. Damaging the spike can also start the countdown to the knockback or restart the countdown if it is already started.
