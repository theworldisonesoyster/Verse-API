## Members
This class has both data members and functions.

### Data
| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| TriggeredEvent | listenable(payload) | Signaled when an agent triggers this device. Sends the agent that used this device. Returns false if no agent triggered the action (ex: it was triggered through code). |

### Functions
| Function Name | Description |
| Disable | Disables this device. |
| Enable | Enables this device. |
| GetGlobalTransform | Gets the global transform of this object. |
| GetMaxTriggerCount | Gets the maximum amount of times this device can trigger. 0 indicates no limit on trigger count. |
| GetResetDelay | Gets the time (in seconds) before the device can be triggered again (if MaxTrigger count allows). |
| GetTransform | Returns the transform of the creative_object with units in cm. You must check creative_object.IsValid before calling this if there is a possibility the object has been disposed or destroyed by gameplay. Otherwise a runtime error will result. |
| GetTransmitDelay | Gets the time (in seconds) which must pass after triggering, before this device informs other external devices that it has been triggered. |
| GetTriggerCountRemaining | Returns the number of times that this device can still be triggered before hitting GetMaxTriggerCount. Returns 0 if GetMaxTriggerCount is unlimited. |
| MoveTo | Moves the creative_object to the specified Position and Rotation over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the creative_object it will be stopped and put into the AnimationNotSet state. |
| MoveTo | Moves the creative_object to the specified Transform over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the creative_object it will be stopped and put into the AnimationNotSet state. |
| MoveTo | Moves the creative_device to the specified Transform over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the creative_device it will be stopped and put into the AnimationNotSet state. |
| Reset | Resets the number of times this device has been activated. This will set GetTriggerCountRemaining back to 0 |
| SetGlobalTransform | Sets the global transform of this object. |
| SetMaxTriggerCount | Sets the maximum amount of times this device can trigger. 0 can be used to indicate no limit on trigger count. MaxCount is clamped between [0,20]. |
| SetResetDelay | Sets the time (in seconds) after triggering, before the device can be triggered again (if MaxTrigger count allows). |
| SetTransmitDelay | Sets the time (in seconds) which must pass after triggering, before this device informs other external devices that it has been triggered. |
| TeleportTo | Teleports the creative_object to the specified Position and Rotation. |
| TeleportTo | Teleports the creative_object to the specified location defined by Transform, also applies rotation and scale accordingly. |
| TeleportTo | Teleports the creative_device to the specified location defined by Transform, also applies rotation and scale accordingly. |
| Trigger | Triggers this device with Agent being passed as the agent that triggered the action. Use an agent reference when this device is setup to require one (for instance, you want to trigger the device only with a particular agent. |
| Trigger | Triggers this device, causing it to activate its TriggeredEvent event. |
