## Classes and Structs
| Name | Description |
| color | Represents colors as RGB triples in the ACES 2065-1 color space. Component values are linear (i.e. *gamma* = 1.0). |
| color_alpha | Represents colors as RGB triples in the ACES 2065-1 color space with an additional alpha channel A. This reasons about the Color and alpha (A) as separate concepts instead of as a single concept. All values are stored strictly as unopinionated floats but, when interpreted as a color with alpha, ranges for A are 0.0 (transparent) to 1.0 (opaque). Color values are not premultiplied. Component values are linear (i.e. *gamma* = 1.0). |

## Functions
| Name | Description |
| operator'+' | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from the component-wise sum of c0 and c1. |
| operator'-' | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from the component-wise difference of c0 and c1. |
| operator'*' | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from the component-wise product of c0 and c1. |
| operator'*' | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from each component of c scaled by factor. |
| operator'*' | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from each component of c scaled by factor. |
| operator'*' | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from each component of c scaled by factor. |
| operator'*' | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from each component of c scaled by factor. |
| operator'/' | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from each component of c divided by factor. |
| operator'/' | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from each component of c divided by factor. |
| MakeColorFromSRGB | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from sRGB components Red, Green, and Blue. Normal sRGB component values are between 0.0 and 1.0, but this can handle larger values. |
| MakeSRGBFromColor | Makes an sRGB tuple by converting InColor from an ACES 2065-1 color to sRGB. |
| MakeColorFromSRGBValues | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from the integer sRGB components Red, Green, and Blue. Valid sRGB component values are between '0' and '255', inclusive. |
| MakeColorFromHex | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from a CSS-style sRGB hexString. Supported formats are: RGB RRGGBB RRGGBBAA RGB RRGGBB RRGGBBAA An invalid hex string will return Black. |
| MakeColorFromHSV | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from Hue, Saturation, and Value components. Components use the HSV color model in the sRGB color space. Expected ranges: 0.0 <= Hue <= 360.0 0.0 <= Saturation <= 1.0 0.0 <= Value <= 1.0 Values out of expected ranges will undergo range reduction and conversion. |
| MakeHSVFromColor | Makes an HSV tuple by converting InColor from an ACES 2065-1 color to sRGB and applying the HSV color model. |
| MakeColorFromTemperature | Makes an ACES 2065-1 color from the chromaticity of a blackbody radiator at Temperature Kelvin. Temperature is clamped such that 0 <= Temperature. |
| MakeColorAlpha | Makes a new color_alpha from individual R, G, B, A component values. |
| Over | Blend colors CA1 and CA2 with CA1 over CA2 using two non-premultiplied color_alpha values. Alpha components are clamped between 0.0 and 1.0. Fails if the value of both clamped Alpha components are 0.0. |
