Represents colors as RGB triples in the ACES 2065-1 color space with an additional alpha channel A. This reasons about the Color and alpha (A) as separate concepts instead of as a single concept. All values are stored strictly as unopinionated floats but, when interpreted as a color with alpha, ranges for A are 0.0 (transparent) to 1.0 (opaque). Color values are not premultiplied. Component values are linear (i.e. *gamma* = 1.0).
