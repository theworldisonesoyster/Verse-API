## Inheritance Hierarchy
This class is derived from the following hierarchy, starting with collision_volume:
| Name | Description |
| collision_volume | Collision Volumes represent the collision shapes of meshes. They can be detected by Overlap and Sweep queries and generate collisions in the physics simulation. |
| collision_element | Base class for collision_volumes that consist of a single volume with a single collision_profile and collision_material for the whole volume. This covers most volume types used in queries and physics, except compound types like a mesh. A query will always return an element rather than a general volume. For example when colliding with a mesh, the element will be a collision_triangle, which is a collision_element and has a single material, rather than a collision_triangle_mesh, which is not an element and has a material palette. |

## Members
This class has both data members and functions.

### Data
| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| Collidable | ?logic | Enable/disable collision on this volume. |
| CollisionProfile | ?collision_profile | The collision_profile for this volume. |
| Length | ?float | The length of the capsule's cylindrical section (distance between the two end cap centers) |
| Queryable | ?logic | Enable/disable spatial queries against this volume. |
| Radius | ?float | The radius of the capsule |

### Functions
| Function Name | Description |
| GetLocalTransform | Get the transform of this volume in the space of its owner (usually a component on an entity) |
| SetLocalTransform | Set the transform of this volume in the space of its owner (usually a component on an entity) |
