A collision profile determines how a volume interacts with other volumes for Overlap queries, Sweep queries, and physics simulation. When two volumes are being tested to see how they interact, the algorithm looks like this: GetInteraction(A:collision_profile, B:collision_profile):collision_interaction = InteractionA = B.GetChannelInteraction(A.Channel) InteractionB = A.GetChannelInteraction(B.Channel) return Min(InteractionA, InteractionB)

## Members
This class has data members, but no functions.

### Data
| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| Channel | collision_channel | The collision channel for the owning object. |
| GetChannelInteraction | (collision_channel):collision_interaction | How the owning object should interact with other objects.GetChannelInteraction is a function which maps a collision_channel to a collision_interaction. It can be implemented as an simple sequence of if statements. For example, to block all channels except camera: BlockAllIgnoreCamera(Channel:collision_channel):collision_interaction = if (CollisionChannels.camera[Channel]): return collision_interaction.Ignore return collision_interaction.Block MyProfile:collision_profile = MakeCollisionProfile(CollisionChannels.dynamic, BlockAllIgnoreCamera) |
