The results of an overlap query. See entity.FindOverlapHits(). We will get one overlap_hit for each intersection of any volume in SourceVolumes with any other volume.

## Members
This struct has data members, but no functions.

### Data
| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| SourceComponent | ?component | The source component and volume (query input). For compound inputs (like an entity hierarchy) this will be a component/volume in that hierarchy. The SourceTransform is the transform of SourceVolume used for the overlap test. For single volume inputs like a sphere, the Source volume and transform are just the inputs to the overlap test, and the component is false. |
| SourceVolume | collision_volume | The source volume (query input) |
| SourceGlobalTransform | transform | The source volume transform |
| TargetComponent | component | The component that was hit by SourceVolume |
| TargetVolume | collision_element | The volume that was hit by SourceVolume |
