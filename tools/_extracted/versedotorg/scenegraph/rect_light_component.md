A rect_light_component emits light into the scene from a rectangular plane with a specified width and height. You can use these to simulate any kind of light sources that have rectangular areas, such as televisions or monitor screens, overhead lighting fixtures, or wall sconces.

## Inheritance Hierarchy
This class is derived from the following hierarchy, starting with component:
| Name | Description |
| component | Base class for authoring logic and data in the SceneGraph. Using components you can author re-usable building blocks of logic and data which can then be added to entities in the scene. Components are a very low level building block which can be used in many ways. For example: Exposing engine level concepts like mesh or sound Adding gameplay capabilities like damage or interaction Storing an inventory for a character in the game As components are generic there is no specific way that they must be used. It is up to the needs of your experience if you use one big game component or if you break up logic into many small components. Classes deriving from component must also specify <final_super> to be added to entities. This ensures the class will always derive directly from component. Further subclassing of the initial derived component is allowed and does not require specifying <final_super> on the derived classes. Only one instance of a component from each subclass group can be added to an entity at a time. For example, given this group of components, only one light_component can exist on a single entity. To create multiple lights you should use multiple entities. light_component := class(component){} capsule_light_component := class(light_component){} directional_light_component := class(light_component){} spot_light_component := class(light_component){} sphere_light_component := class(light_component){} rect_light_component := class(light_component){} ============================================================================== Component Lifetime Components move through a series of lifetime functions as they are added to entities, added to the scene, and begin running in the simulation. Components should override these methods to perform setup and run their simulation. As a component shuts down it will then move through shutdown version of these functions, giving users the opportunity to clean up any retained state on the component before it is disposed . Lifetime Methods: OnAddedToScene OnBeginSimulation -> OnSimulate OnEndSimulation OnRemovingFromScene ============================================================================== |
| light_component | Base class for light components in the SceneGraph. Dependencies: transform_component on the entity positions the light. Examples of components implementing light_component: directional_light_component capsule_light_component sphere_light_component rect_light_component spot_light_component |

## Members
This class has both data members and functions.

### Data
| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| AttenuationRadius | ??float | The bounds of the light's visible influence, in centimeters. This clamping of the light's influence is not physically correct but very important for performance, larger lights cost more. The light falloff is based on Inverse Square law. Towards the tail end of the AttenuationRadius, there is an additional smoothing factor to fade out the light contribution to 0 to avoid a hard cutoff. |
| BarnDoorAngleDegrees | ?float | The angle of the barn door in degrees attached to the light source rect. Clamped between 0.0 and 90.0 degrees. |
| BarnDoorLength | ?float | The length of the barn door attached to the light source rect, in centimeters. |
| CastShadows | ?logic | Whether the light should cast any shadows. |
| ColorFilter | ?color | Set the filter color of the light. This acts as a colored filter in front of the light source. Note that this can change the light's effective intensity. In normalized range 0-1. |
| DiffuseScale | ?float | Multiplier on diffuse lighting. Any value besides 1.0 is not physical. 0.0 means no diffuse contribution from this light. |
| Entity | entity | The parent entity of this component. Components must have a parent entity pointer provided when being constructed. Components cannot be moved between parents. |
| Intensity | ?float | Set the visible light intensity emitted in SI unit Candela. Specified before ColorFilter (which multiplies each color component after the intensity calculation and can change the effective intensity of the light). |
| SourceHeight | ?float | The height of the light source rect, in centimeters. Note that light source's shapes which intersect shadow casting geometry can cause shadowing artifacts. |
| SourceWidth | ?float | The width of the light source rect, in centimeters. Note that light source shapes which intersect shadow casting geometry can cause shadowing artifacts. |
| SpecularScale | ?float | Multiplier on specular highlights. Can be used to artistically remove highlights mimicking polarizing filters or photo touch up. Any value besides 1.0 is not physical. 0.0 means no specular contribution from this light. |
| TickEvents | ?tick_events | Set callbacks to TickEvents.PrePhysics and TickEvents.PostPhysics to receive per-frame updates before and after physics is updated on your object. |

### Functions
| Function Name | Description |
| Disable | Disables rendering of this light. |
| Enable | Enables rendering of this light. |
| IsEnabled | Succeeds if the component is enabled, fails if it's disabled. |
| IsInScene | Succeeds if the component is currently in the scene. After OnAddedToScene is called this call succeeds. After OnRemovingFromScene is called this call fails. |
| IsSimulating | Succeeds if the component is currently simulating. After OnBeginSimulation is called this call succeeds. After OnEndSimulation is called this call fails. |
| OnAddedToScene | Called when the component is added to the scene by parenting it under the simulation entity or another entity already in the scene. Querying for components in the scene is valid after this phase completes. |
| OnBeginSimulation | Called when the component begins simulating within the scene. Use this to set up TickEvent callbacks or other setup that must be guaranteed to complete immediately. OnAddedToScene is guaranteed to run before OnBeginSimulation. |
| OnEndSimulation | Called when the component ends simulation within the scene. Simulation ends on a component when the experience resets, the parent entity is removed from the scene. Cached TickEvents cancelables should be canceled in OnEndSimulation. OnSimulate task will be canceled before OnEndSimulation is called. OnEndSimulation is only called on components that have already had OnBeginSimulation called. |
| OnReceive | Respond to a scene event. Return true to consume the event and halt propagation to the next entity. |
| OnRemovingFromScene | Called when the component is about to be removed from the scene. Components are removed from a scene when the parent entity is removed from the scene. OnRemovingFromScene is only called on components that have already had OnAddedToScene called. |
| OnSimulate | Called when the component begins simulating within the scene. Use this to add asynchronous/suspends update logic for a component. OnBeginSimulation is guaranteed to run before OnSimulate. OnSimulate will be cancelled before OnEndSimulation |
| RemoveFromEntity | Removes the component from the entity. Removed components are removed from the scene and can only be added back to the same entity. Flows through OnEndSimulation-> OnRemovingFromScene. |
| SendDown | Send a scene event to this component, invoking OnReceive. Returns true if any participant consumed the event. |
