The results of a sweep query. See entity.FindSweepHits(). We will get one sweep_hit for each intersection of any volume in SourceVolumes with any other volume.

## Members
This struct has data members, but no functions.

### Data
| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| SourceComponent | ?component | The source component and volume (query input). For compound inputs (like an entity hierarchy) this will be a component/volume in that hierarchy. The SourceGlobalTransform is the transform of SourceVolume at the start of the sweep. For single volume inputs like a sphere, the volume and transform are just the inputs to the sweep, and the component is false. |
| SourceVolume | collision_volume | The source volume (query input). |
| SourceStartGlobalTransform | transform | The source volume transform at the start of the sweep. |
| SourceHitTranslation | vector3 | The world-space translation (relative to SourceStartGlobalTransform) of SourceVolume when it touches TargetVolume. |
| SourceHitDistance | float | The Distance along the sweep at which SourceVolume touches TargetVolume. |
| TargetComponent | component | The component that was hit by SourceVolume. |
| TargetVolume | collision_element | The volume that was hit by SourceVolume. |
| ContactPosition | vector3 | The point of contact between SourceVolume and TargetVolume. |
| ContactNormal | vector3 | The normal on TargetVolume at the HitPosition. |
| ContactFaceNormal | vector3 | If TargetVolume is a polygonal object (mesh, convex hull, etc.) and the contact point is on an edge or vertex, this is the most-opposing face normal of the faces that share that edge or vertex. Otherwise it is the same as HitNormal. |
