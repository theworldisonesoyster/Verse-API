## Exposed Interfaces
This class exposes the following interfaces:
| Name | Description |
| signalable(payload) | A parametric interface implemented by events with a payload that can be signaled. Can be used with awaitable, subscribable, or both (see: listenable). |
| awaitable(payload) | A parametric interface implemented by events with a payload that can be waited on. Matched with signalable. |

## Members
This class has functions, but no data members.

### Functions
| Function Name | Description |
| Await | Suspends the current task until another task calls Signal. If called during another invocation of Signal, the the task will still suspend and resume during the next call to Signal. |
| Signal | Concurrently resumes the tasks that were suspended by Await calls before this call to Signal. Tasks are resumed in the order they were suspended. Each task will perform as much work as it can until it encounters a blocking call, whereupon it will transfer control to the next suspended task. |
